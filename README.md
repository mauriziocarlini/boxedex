# BOXEDEX - Pokémon Living Dex Helper
This web app helps you organize your Pokémon in your boxes.

Just search for the Pokémon, and Boxedex will tell you the Box, the Row and the Column where you need to place your little friend.

It also helps you by visualizing a Box grid preview.

You can save Boxedex on the homescreen of your device, and use it as a native app.
